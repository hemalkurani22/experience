Intended Use: 
DermaScan is intended for over-the-counter, non-invasive use by adult consumers to collect a facial swab sample and assess general skin wellness characteristics, including skin surface pH, moisture level, oiliness, and microbial presence. The device analyzes these non-clinical indicators using software-driven algorithms and provides personalized recommendations for cosmetic products and dietary supplements that may support skin health and appearance. DermaScan is not intended for the diagnosis, treatment, mitigation, or prevention of any disease or medical condition. It is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. The device is intended for general wellness use only and is not regulated as an in vitro diagnostic medical device (IVD).
