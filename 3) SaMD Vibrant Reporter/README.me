Vibrant Reporter software is designed to analyze and interpret raw data files produced by laboratory instruments, which includes real‑time polymerase chain reaction (RT‑PCR) instruments, mass‑spectrometry instruments, microarray scanners instruments and chemiluminescence instruments. It processes data derived from human specimens by applying validated algorithms for each test and converts it into reportable test results. It displays the test results and associated annotations from clinical information from public literature, databases and internal performance studies. The Vibrant Reporter software supports workflow automation for transfer of test results and associated annotations to external systems, such as Laboratory Information Systems (LIS).

The Vibrant Reporter software is intended for use by qualified laboratory personnel within accredited laboratories. The Vibrant Reporter software validation as part of the test post analytical workflow is the responsibility of the laboratory. Final interpretation of test results and any diagnostic or treatment decisions remain the responsibility of qualified healthcare professionals. 
Vibrant Sciences makes no warranties regarding the accuracy or reliability of associated annotations expressed in test results generated by the Vibrant Reporter software.
